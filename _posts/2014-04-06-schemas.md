##Overview
Schemas are the centerpoint of the FSSI File Processor. They contain all of the business rules for validation, as well as define the standard structure for output.

leveraging the principles of [CSV Lint](http://csvlint.io) and based upon the [JSON Table Schema RFC](http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/), The FSSI File Processor Schemas are written in [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).


##Features
Here are some of the things that set our schemas and validation process apart from other tools and services:

1. **Multiple Error Levels**: Constraints and Types can be configured to fail as a Earning, Error, or Fatal. This helps teams better define which issues are imporant. 
2. **Effective Date Based Validations**: As business rules change for providers over time, your schemas can too. Constraints can be configured with effective dates that will actually tailor the schema at runtime to only enforce validations relevant to that file.
3. **Alias' and Field Name Mappings**: Sometimes, field names change over time. In other scenarios, different providers call the same field 2 different things. With Alias', you can actually create a data dictionary that will map fields to the correct field.


##Structure
The basic structure of the Schema is as follows


	Schema
     	Schema Descriptors
     	Field 1
     		Field 1 Descriptors
     		Constraint 1
     			Constraint 1 Descriptor
     		Constraint n
     			Constraint n Descriptor  
     	Field 2
     	Field 3
     	Field n
     etc...     			   			


As you can see, there is a parent->child relationship between the schemas, fields, and constraints objects


##XSD
When creating your schema, we highly recommend performing XSD Schema Validation (which can be easily done through a website like [http://www.xmlvalidation.com/](http://www.xmlvalidation.com/)). The current version of the FSSI File Processor XSD can be found here: [https://github.com/GSA/fssi-file-processor/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema.xsd](https://github.com/GSA/fssi-file-processor/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema.xsd).

This will allow you to quickly root out issues with the schema.
