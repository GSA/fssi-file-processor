<p>Traditional Data warehouses and Data Integration platforms provide a great way to manage structured data. But what happens when your data is semi-structured? or unstructured? This application aims to "Assist" with turning semi-structured and unstructured data into structured data.</p>

<p>This J2SE Application, which is used by the FSSI Data Management team, pre-processes Source files for validation and data ingest into the FSSI Data Management Data Warehouse.</p>

<p>The FSSI File Processor at its core can accept information from a multitude of different file types, process that data as standard java objects, and then export that data in any format requested (Pretty cool, right?).</p>
