But what happens when your data is semi-structured? or unstructured? This application aims to \"Assist\" with turning semi-structured and unstructured data into structured data.\r\n\r\nThis J2SE Application, which is used by the FSSI Data Management team, pre-processes Source files for validation and data ingest into the FSSI Data Management Data Warehouse.\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nThe FSSI File Processor at its core can accept information from a multitude of different file types, process that data as standard java objects, and then export that data in any format requested (Pretty cool, right?).\r\n\r\nThe FSSI File Processor has 4 main objects that server as inputs to the process; \r\n\r\n1. [**Providers**](/working/providers/): Providers tell you how a file should be processed. All Schemas, Source Files, and Data Mappings must be represented by a provider.\r\n2. [**Source Files**](/working/srcfiles/): These are the files that are provided to you by the provider.\r\n3. [**Schemas**](/working/schemas/): are the building blocks for file validation. Regardless of whether you are provided a .csv, .xlsx, .txt, etc... data should be validated based upon its \"Schema.\" Schemas are not required, but are important to the FSSI Data Management team for validating data quality and consistancy.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\nThe FSSI File processor itself is run on files. It uses the above objects to run itself. At a minimum you must have [Providers](../working/providers/) and [Source Files](../working/srcfiles/). \r\n\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\nThe FSSI File Processor is configured in 2 main ways:\r\n\r\n1. Global configuration via the ##config.properties file\r\n2. Local configuration via ##Providers files.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Running the FSSI File Processor\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n##Point of Contact\r\nIf you have any questions on this repository, please feel free to contact [strategicsourcing@gsa.gov](mailto:strategicsourcing@gsa.gov).\r\n","google":"UA-32509064-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
